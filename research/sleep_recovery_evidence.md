# Sleep and Recovery Evidence

Evidence for sleep interventions and recovery protocols in athletic populations.

## RULE_SLEEP_HYGIENE

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC022]
- **decision:** Sleep hygiene practices improve athletic performance and recovery. SWS (slow-wave sleep) critical for physical recovery, growth hormone, metabolic stress.
- **limitations:** Individual variation; travel and fixture congestion complicate implementation.

## RULE_NAP_SUPPLEMENT

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC022]
- **decision:** Napping supplements nighttime sleep; improves fatigue perception, physical performance, cognitive function. Most extensively studied sleep intervention.
- **limitations:** Timing and duration matter; avoid late naps that disrupt nocturnal sleep.

## RULE_SLEEP_EXTENSION

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC022]
- **decision:** Sleep extension improves cognitive and physical performance plus sport-specific skill execution.
- **limitations:** Feasibility in real-world schedules; baseline sleep debt matters.

## RULE_TRAINING_SLEEP_BALANCE

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC022]
- **decision:** When training volume/intensity increases, SWS typically rises. Overtraining can disrupt this. Prioritize sleep during high-load phases.
- **limitations:** Mechanism research limited; practical implementation varies.
