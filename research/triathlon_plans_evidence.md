# Triathlon Plans Evidence

Evidence for triathlon training plans by distance. Swim/bike/run distribution and periodization.

## RULE_TRIATHLON_DURATION

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC025]
- **decision:** Sprint 12–16 weeks; Olympic 16 weeks; 70.3 (Half-Ironman) 12–20 weeks; Full Ironman 20–24 weeks. Beginners need longer; experienced athletes can use shorter plans.
- **limitations:** Plan length varies by prior fitness and target finish time.

## RULE_TRIATHLON_WEEKLY_DISTRIBUTION

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC025]
- **decision:** Sprint/Olympic: 2 swim, 2 bike, 2 run per week; occasional brick. 70.3: 3 swim, 3 bike, 3 run; brick workouts on even weeks. Ironman: 2–3 each; brick in build/peak. Balance easy recovery with harder threshold/interval sessions.
- **limitations:** Total sessions depend on available hours; 9–12 sessions/week typical for 70.3.

## RULE_TRIATHLON_PHASES

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC001, SRC003, SRC025]
- **decision:** Base → Build → Peak → Taper (analogous to marathon). Base: aerobic fitness, technique drills, Zone 2. Build: intensity, tempo, race-pace work. Peak: race simulation, brick runs, open-water swim. Taper: 2–3 weeks; reduce volume 30–50%, maintain intensity.
- **limitations:** Phase lengths vary by athlete and race distance.

## RULE_TRIATHLON_VOLUME_PEAK

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC025]
- **decision:** Example 70.3 peak week: ~6,700 yards swim, 5h20 bike, 3h run (Week 17). Olympic peak: ~3,000 yards swim, 3h05 bike, 1h41 run. Ironman: 12–14 h/week peak; 6–9 sessions total.
- **limitations:** Volume is plan-specific; adjust for athlete capacity and time constraints.
