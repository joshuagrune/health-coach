# Cycling Plans Evidence

Evidence for cycling training periodization. Intensity distribution aligns with `endurance_zone_hiit_evidence.md`.

## RULE_CYCLING_PHASES

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC003, SRC016]
- **decision:** Base (6 months before A-race) → Build (12–16 weeks before) → Peak (6–8 weeks before) → Taper. Recovery weeks every 3–4 weeks.
- **limitations:** Timing varies by athlete and race calendar; recreational vs competitive differs.

## RULE_CYCLING_BASE

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC003, SRC015, SRC016]
- **decision:** 12–16 weeks; Zone 2 endurance rides + max 3 HIIT sessions per week; polarized approach; optional strength 2×/week. 3-day blocks: energy-system session, aerobic threshold, basic aerobic.
- **limitations:** Modern plans blend Zone 2 with HIIT rather than pure low-intensity base.

## RULE_CYCLING_BUILD

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC003]
- **decision:** 8–12 weeks; increase intensity and complexity; tempo efforts, hills, longer rides; undulating periodization (vary stimulus every 4 weeks) to avoid adaptation plateau.
- **limitations:** Volume and intensity progression individual; avoid monotony.

## RULE_CYCLING_PEAK

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC001, SRC003]
- **decision:** Taper volume while maintaining intensity; race-simulation sessions; reduce weekly volume 30–50% in final 2–3 weeks.
- **limitations:** Taper duration and magnitude depend on prior load; see `tapering_evidence.md`.
