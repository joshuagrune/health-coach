# Running Plans Evidence

Evidence for running training plans by distance. Marathon periodization details in `marathon_periodization.md`.

## Marathon

- **Reference:** See `marathon_periodization.md` for Base → Build → Peak → Taper phases.
- **Source:** SRC017 — 92 sub-elite marathon plans; pyramidal intensity (~65% Zone 2); low/middle/high volume categories (43–108 km/week in final 12 weeks).

## RULE_RUNNING_HALF_MARATHON

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC007, SRC017]
- **decision:** 12–16 week plan; progressive long runs; tempo at 10K–half pace; intervals at 3K–5K pace; cutback weeks every 3–4 weeks; structure similar to marathon but shorter LR.
- **limitations:** Less literature than marathon; extrapolated from marathon and 10K evidence.

## RULE_RUNNING_10K

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC007, SRC008]
- **decision:** 8 weeks typical; three run types: easy (conversational), tempo/speed, long (extend ~1 km/week); 10% weekly mileage increase cap; 1–2× strength for injury prevention (glutes, hamstrings, core).
- **limitations:** Recovery in days not weeks; lactate threshold focus since 10K pace near threshold.

## RULE_RUNNING_5K

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC003, SRC018]
- **decision:** Shorter prep than 10K; higher proportion of tempo and interval work; less long-run emphasis; 1–2 HIIT sessions per week.
- **limitations:** Few dedicated 5K plan analyses; inferred from 10K and intensity-distribution evidence.
