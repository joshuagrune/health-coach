# Flexibility and Mobility Evidence

Evidence for stretching, mobility, and range-of-motion training.

## RULE_STRETCH_VOLUME

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC020]
- **decision:** Larger total stretching volume improves flexibility. Effects within 2–4 weeks. Intensity, age, sex, training status do not significantly moderate.
- **limitations:** Optimal dose varies by joint/muscle; consistency matters.

## RULE_STRETCH_VS_FOAM_ROLLING

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC021]
- **decision:** Static stretching produces greater ROM gains in ≤4 weeks vs foam rolling. Long-term effects comparable.
- **limitations:** Both increase ROM; choice may depend on preference and context.

## RULE_STRETCH_TYPE

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC020]
- **decision:** Long-term static and PNF stretching produce greater ROM gains than dynamic/ballistic. Females show higher flexibility gains than males.
- **limitations:** Acute vs chronic effects differ; warm-up context matters.
