# Endurance, Zone 2, and HIIT Evidence

Evidence for endurance training intensity distribution, zone 2, polarized training, and HIIT. Marathon-specific periodization remains in `marathon_periodization.md`.

## RULE_POLARIZED_SHORT_TERM

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC015]
- **decision:** Polarized distribution (mostly easy + some hard) superior for VO2peak in interventions <12 weeks among trained athletes.
- **limitations:** Advantage conditional; no significant difference for time-trial, time to exhaustion, or threshold metrics.

## RULE_MAJORITY_LOW_INTENSITY

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC016, SRC017]
- **decision:** >60% of endurance training at low intensity. Elite athletes typically >80% easy in running/XC; cyclists/swimmers often 72–80% Zone 1.
- **limitations:** Sport-specific; pyramidal also common.

## RULE_HIIT_FREQUENCY

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC018]
- **decision:** 1–2 HIIT sessions per week can produce meaningful adaptations. Work-bout and recovery duration are critical FITT parameters.
- **limitations:** Elite athletes ~100 hard sessions per 500 total annually; not daily HIIT.

## RULE_HIIT_RECOVERY_INTERVAL

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC018, SRC019]
- **decision:** Recovery interval duration manipulates acute response. Fixed vs self-selected rest equally effective when total rest controlled.
- **limitations:** Self-selection may improve adherence/autonomy.

## RULE_INTERVALS_MISSED_DROP

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC003, SRC018]
- **decision:** If Intervals/HIIT missed: drop this week. Lowest-priority key workout; do not cram.
- **limitations:** Swap only if no back-to-back hard and LR preserved.
