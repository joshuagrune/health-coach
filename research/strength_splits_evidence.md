# Strength Splits Evidence

Evidence for strength training split selection. General strength rules remain in `strength_training_evidence.md`.

## RULE_STRENGTH_SPLIT_CHOICE

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC023]
- **decision:** Full-body vs split routines produce similar strength and hypertrophy when total volume is equated. Choose based on user preference, schedule, and recovery capacity.
- **limitations:** 14 studies, 392 subjects; individual response varies; exercise selection within split matters.

## RULE_STRENGTH_SPLIT_FREQUENCY

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011, SRC023]
- **decision:** Per-muscle-group frequency matters more than split type for hypertrophy. PPL and Upper/Lower (2×/week per group) typically outperform Bro-Split (1×/week) when volume matched.
- **limitations:** Bro-split can work for beginners; advanced lifters may need higher frequency.

## RULE_STRENGTH_UPPER_BODY_ONLY

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011]
- **decision:** For lower-body injury: 3×/week upper-body only; seated or kneeling exercises only; 6–7 exercises per session; progress via time-under-tension or load.
- **limitations:** No direct RCT; based on injury-recovery practice. Resume lower-body when cleared.

## RULE_STRENGTH_PPL_OPTIMAL

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011]
- **decision:** PPL at 6 days/week = 2×/week per muscle group; optimal for hypertrophy. 60–90 min per session; 15–20 sets per session. Best for intermediate+ (6+ months experience).
- **limitations:** <5–6 days reduces frequency below optimal; consider Upper/Lower instead.

## RULE_STRENGTH_UPPER_LOWER

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011, SRC023]
- **decision:** 4 days/week Upper/Lower = 2×/week per muscle group; practical alternative to PPL when 6 days not feasible. Adequate recovery between same-muscle sessions.
- **limitations:** Slightly lower total volume per week than 6-day PPL; sufficient for most goals.
