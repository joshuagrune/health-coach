# Strength Training Evidence

Evidence for strength-focused planning rules. Marathon/endurance rules remain in `marathon_periodization.md`, `load_management_and_injury_risk.md`.

## RULE_STRENGTH_PROGRESSION

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011, SRC012]
- **decision:** Progressive overload via sets/reps or load. 2–4 sessions/week; volume equated, frequency benefits strength more than hypertrophy.
- **limitations:** Individual response varies; fractional volume (direct vs indirect sets) matters for specificity.

## RULE_STRENGTH_FREQUENCY

- **evidenceType:** evidence_based
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011]
- **decision:** ≥3 days/week provides greater strength gains than lower frequency when volume equated. Hypertrophy: frequency effect negligible when volume matched.
- **limitations:** Diminishing returns; advanced athletes may need different dosing.

## RULE_STRENGTH_DELOAD

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC013, SRC014]
- **decision:** Planned deload every 5–6 weeks; 6–7 days. Reduce volume (sets/reps), maintain frequency and exercise selection. Increase RIR (reps in reserve).
- **limitations:** One-week midpoint deload may reduce strength gains vs continuous; hypertrophy similar. Use for fatigue management.

## RULE_STRENGTH_MISSED_SWAP

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** moderate
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011]
- **decision:** If strength session missed: swap to next available day if no back-to-back hard. Do not cram two heavy sessions adjacent.
- **limitations:** Volume equated over week preferred; single-session swap acceptable.

## RULE_NO_BACK_TO_BACK_HARD (Strength)

- **evidenceType:** coach_heuristic
- **confidence:** high
- **sourceIds:** [SRC011, SRC013]
- **decision:** No back-to-back heavy strength days; allow 48h+ between maximal or near-maximal sessions for same muscle groups.
- **limitations:** Full-body vs split alters interpretation; recovery capacity varies.
